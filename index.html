    				<p class="reveal">In the US, most healthcare providers have adopted an electronic healthcare record (EHR) or other software for capturing clinical information. This technology isn't a silver bullet though. Healthcare data can remain trapped within these systems. Even today, clinicians still fall back on old and inefficient ways of sharing clinical information from faxing chart notes to manually sharing paper-based documents. Without the seamless exchange of healthcare data, it can be difficult for clinicians caring for a patient to get the complete picture of the person's current health. This lack of coordination in the care of patients impacts the ability of clinicians to make appropriate clinical decisions and negatively impacts patient care. There are numerous examples where this lack of access to data has led to actual patient harm including death.</p>
    				<p class="reveal">On this page, we will try to demystify some of the terms and acronyms that measure developers may come across in this space.</p>

				<p class="reveal">A standard is simply a commonly agreed way of doing something. And, a data standard is an agreement related to the representation, format, definition, structuring, tagging, transmission, manipulation, use, and management of data. In our modern world, the adoption of data standards has allowed for surfing the world-wide web, making purchases online, and even reserving a flight using a third-party website. While these activities are still possible without standards, it is considerably more difficult for a vendor to deal with numerous different interfaces rather than just one.</p>

				<p class="reveal">It is also notable that the content in the core specification is meant to cover the top 80% of use cases.

More recent standards (i.e., HL7 V3) were commonly criticized for trying to account for too many use cases in the core standard, thus leading to an overly complex standard that was difficult to achieve.</p>
