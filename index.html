    				<p class="reveal">In the US, most healthcare providers have adopted an electronic healthcare record (EHR) or other software for capturing clinical information. This isn't a silver bullet though. Healthcare data can remain trapped within these systems. Even today, clinicians still fall back on old and inefficient ways of sharing clinical information from faxing chart notes to manually sharing paper-based documents. Without the seamless exchange of healthcare data, it can be difficult for clinicians caring for a patient to get the complete picture of the personâ€™s current health. This lack of coordination in the care of patients impacts the ability of clinicians to make appropriate clinical decisions and negatively impacts patient care. There are numerous examples where this lack of access to data has led to actual patient harm including death.</p>
    				<p class="reveal">On this page, we will try to demystify some of the terms and acronyms that measure developers may come across in this world.</p>

				<p class="reveal">A standard is simply a commonly agreed way of doing something. And, a data standard is an agreement related to the representation, format, definition, structuring, tagging, transmission, manipulation, use, and management of data. In our modern world, the adoption of data standards has allowed for surfing the world-wide web, making purchases online, and even reserving a flight using a third-party website. While these activities are still possible without standards, it is considerably more difficult for a vendor to deal with numerous different interfaces rather than just one.</p>

  				<p class="reveal">The standard focuses on speed to learn and implement, lowering costs, scaling well from simple to complex, flexibility, and keeping the standard free to use. And, it leverages existing web technologies such as HTTP, REST, JSON, XML, and OAuth. These technologies should be familiar to most developers, reducing the learning curve compared with other standards.</p>

						<th>Technology</th>
						<th>Description</th>

					<tr>
						<td>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</td>
						<td>The protocol allows for communication between clients (e.g., browser) and servers on the World Wide Web. The primary or most commonly-used HTTP methods are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These methods correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively.</td>					
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>REpresentational State Transfer (REST)</td>
						<td>
							<p>The RESTful API architecture is built on the following guiding principles:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Uniform interface for identifying and manipulating resources</li>
								<li>Separation of concerns between the client and server so each can evolve independently</li>
								<li>Stateless in that it requires that requests from the client to the server contain all information necessary to complete the request</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Note: An application user programming interface (API) defines how two software applications communicate with each other using requests and responses</p>
						</td>

					<tr>
						<td>Javascript Object Notation (JSON)</td>
						<td>JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. It is used for sending data from a server to a client in most modern web applications.</td>					
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>eXtensible Markup Language (XML)</td>
						<td>XML is a markup language much, like HTML which is used web pages. Like JSON, it was designed to store and transport data.</td>					
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Open Authorization (OAuth)</td>
						<td>OAuth is a standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords. This mechanism is used by companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Twitter to permit the users to share information about their accounts with third-party applications or websites.</td>

				<p class="reveal">FHIR includes a data model in the form of resources and a specification for the exchange of these resources via a RESTful API as well as messaging and documents.</p>
				<ul class="reveal">
					<li class="reveal">Resources span many concepts including the individual (e.g., Patient), workflow (e.g., Appointment), patient management (e.g., Encounter), clinical treatment (e.g., Condition, Observation, MediationRequest, CarePlan, Communication), and financial transactions (e.g., Coverage, Claim).</li>
					<li class="reveal">Messages are used to communicate multiple resources in a single exchange.</li>
					<li class="reveal">Documents focus on persistence when data touches multiple resources.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="reveal">It is also notable that the content in the core specification is meant to cover the top 80% of use cases. Unlike older standards (i.e., HL7 V2), the extensions are cleaner and easier. The idea is to focus on the real needs of the industry but allow for all the special use cases as well. More recent standards (i.e., HL7 V3) were commonly criticized for trying to account for too many use cases in the core standard, thus leading to an overly complex standard that was difficult to achieve.</p>

  				<p class="reveal">In 2020, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) finalized a mandate for the use of FHIR by a variety of CMS-regulated payers and providers beginning in mid-2021. These rules have far reaching implications for healthcare providers, payers, and health IT vendors.</p>
				<ul class="reveal">
					<li class="reveal">Health IT Vendors must have a FHIR API that allows patients access to their data. </li>
					<li class="reveal">Providers must have FHIR-based APIs to share data with payers and the patient's other providers. </li>
					<li class="reveal">Payers must have FHIR-based APIs that serve as a provider directory as well as payer-to-payer exchange.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="reveal">There are some exceptions to these rules.
